      "Response:\n",
      "Diet Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Protein Intake: Since you follow a pescatarian diet, make sure to include a variety of fish in your diet such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, which are high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Include other sources of protein like eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Calcium and Vitamin D: To protect your bones and joints, it's important to have enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Incorporate dairy products, fortified plant-based milks, tofu, and leafy green vegetables into your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Healthy Fats: Include sources of healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, and nuts in your diet. These can help reduce inflammation and support joint health.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Hydration: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support your body's overall health and recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Balanced Meals: Ensure that each meal includes a balance of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. This can help with satiety, energy levels, and overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exercise Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine at least 2-3 times a week. Focus on exercises that target the major muscle groups like squats, lunges, and deadlifts. Start with bodyweight exercises and gradually add weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Flexibility Training: Include regular stretching and flexibility exercises in your routine. Yoga or Pilates can be particularly beneficial for improving flexibility. Be sure to warm up before stretching and cool down after workouts to prevent injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Low-Impact Cardio: Given your knee pain, opt for low-impact cardio exercises like swimming, cycling, or using an elliptical machine. These can help improve cardiovascular health without putting excess strain on your joints.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Proper Form: When doing any type of exercise, pay attention to your form. Ensure that you're using correct technique to prevent injury and get the most out of your workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Rest and Recovery: Allow your body time to recover between workouts. This is crucial for muscle repair and growth. Aim for at least one full rest day per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Consult a Professional: Given your knee pain, it may be beneficial to consult with a physical therapist or personal trainer who can recommend specific exercises to help strengthen the surrounding muscles and improve joint stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or dietitian before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual health needs and goals.\n"
